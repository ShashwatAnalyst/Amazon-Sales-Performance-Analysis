## About
This project focuses on analyzing sales data to identify high-performing regions, evaluate product performance, and understand customer purchasing behavior. The primary objective is to provide actionable insights through an **interactive Tableau dashboard**, enabling better decision-making for sales strategies and business growth.  

The dataset utilized in this project is a publicly available **dummy dataset sourced from Kaggle**. It simulates transactions across different regions, products, and customer segments, making it suitable for practicing data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and dashboard building.


## Purposes of the Project
The main goal of this project is to explore sales data across **products, customers, and regions** and present findings in an interactive way using Tableau.  
By analyzing revenue, profit, and customer behavior, this project helps uncover **patterns, trends, and opportunities** to optimize sales and profitability.


## About Data
This Amazon projectâ€™s data is sourced from Kaggle and contains sales transactions with attributes like product details, customer segments, revenue, and regional information.

## Analysis List

  
1. **Sales Analysis**  
   > Understand sales patterns across different time periods and regions, evaluate revenue and profit contribution, and identify growth opportunities.
2. **Product Analysis**  
   > Analyze sales by product category, identify top-performing products, and highlight underperforming ones.  

3. **Customer & Regional Analysis**  
   > Study customer segments, purchasing trends, and profitability across regions to uncover behavioral insights.  


## Approach Used

***1. Data Wrangling***  
- Used **Pandas** for cleaning and integration.  
- Handled missing values, corrected data types, and standardized categories.  
- Ensured data was properly structured for Tableau import.  

***2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)***  
- Conducted **trend analysis** using Matplotlib & Seaborn.  
- Plotted product-level, customer-level, and region-level distributions.  
- Identified key revenue drivers and anomalies.  

***3. Dashboard Creation (Tableau)***  
Designed an interactive dashboard with the following features:  
- **Donut expansion on hover** â†’ Revenue â†’ Profit Margin  
- **Regional filters** with parameter-driven highlights  
- **Profit vs. Revenue segmentation** in pie charts  
- **Map visualization** with circle size = Revenue and color = Profit  
- **Custom tooltips & hover-expansion** for deeper insights

## Insights from Dashboard
- Identified top-performing regions driving majority of sales.  
- Segmented **revenue vs. profit** to spot high-revenue but low-profit categories.  
- Highlighted customer segments with **higher-than-average contribution**.  
- Used map visualizations to detect geographical sales patterns.
